But the code wasn't all copy, This was my first time 
using to build somethig Javascript and I also wanted to make 
this website mt own not some copy with basic changes.

So I had to understand every bit of code before applying
while doing that I got to learn and understand new concepts 
Building this website was really fun and

This is my first time adding something to my github
I was really confused at first
But it looks like I have figured it.

If you found some fault in my degine or in my code
pls let me know

thank you
